Odin requirements:

CURRENT:
Fixed grid where user can select different grid sizes with button. Deleted alot of unnecessary css.

1) on hover over change to a random color
2) on every pass over + 10% black so that at 10 pass overs its completely (100%) black


OLD:
1) make sure that if someone selects amount of rows and amount of columns it actually creates the right amount of rows and columns rather than just the right amount of divs
2) somehow make sure that however many rows and columns are chosen they take up 100% of the width and height

made it to point 3: add a hover effect. did it succesfully in CSS but maybe goot to try and do it with JS as well. you know, for science.
